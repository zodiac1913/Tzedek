  "Missing Navigation Landmark": {
    overview: "This finding appears when the page has navigation content but does not expose a clear navigation landmark.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Screen reader users often jump between page regions instead of linearly exploring the full page.",
      "Without a navigation landmark, repeated menus and site navigation are harder to find or skip.",
      "Clear regions reduce noise and help users get to the right part of the page faster."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Wrap repeated navigation in a native nav element or a navigation landmark role.",
      "Give the landmark a useful label when there is more than one navigation region.",
      "Do not use generic div containers when the content is clearly navigation."
    ]
  },
  "Missing Main Landmark": {
    overview: "This finding appears when the page does not expose a clear main content region.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Users need a fast way to bypass repeated page chrome and reach the primary content.",
      "The main landmark works with skip links, rotor views, and region navigation.",
      "A missing main region weakens orientation on content-heavy or application-like pages."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Mark the primary content area with a native main element when possible.",
      "Keep only one main region per page view unless a special case truly requires otherwise.",
      "Make sure the main region reflects the actual page content, not only a wrapper shell."
    ]

  "Iframe Missing Title": {
    overview: "This finding appears when an embedded frame has no accessible title describing what users are about to enter.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Users may enter the frame without knowing its purpose, source, or task.",
      "Frames often create a major context switch, so naming them matters more than many authors expect.",
      "A missing frame title leaves users guessing whether the content is important, decorative, or interactive."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Name the actual content or task inside the frame.",
      "Avoid generic titles like 'frame', 'content', or 'widget'.",
      "If the frame is interactive, mention the interaction goal, not just the container type."
    ]
  },
  "Table Missing Caption": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a data table does not include a caption explaining what the table is about.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Users often need the table topic before they can make sense of the rows and columns.",
      "A caption gives screen reader and visual users the same quick summary of the table's purpose.",
      "Without a caption, large or complex tables can feel like unlabeled data blocks."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Write a caption that explains the table topic, not just the word 'table'.",
      "Keep the caption close to the table so users encounter it before the cells.",
      "Use the caption for the overall table purpose, not for per-cell instructions."
    ]
  },
  "Table Missing thead": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a data table lacks a clear header section grouping the column headers.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "A header section makes the table structure more explicit for browsers, tools, and developers reviewing the markup.",
      "When headers are scattered into body rows, table relationships are easier to misunderstand or break later.",
      "A clear thead is especially useful when tables are restyled, exported, or made responsive."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Move the real header row into a thead when the table is presenting tabular data.",
      "Keep body rows in tbody so header and data roles stay distinct.",
      "If the top row is not truly a header, reconsider whether the table is actually a data table."
    ]
  },
  "Table Missing tbody": {
    overview: "This finding appears when table body rows are not grouped into a tbody section.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "A tbody keeps data rows separate from header rows and makes the table structure easier to interpret and maintain.",
      "Clear row grouping helps when tables are restyled, manipulated by scripts, or reviewed by assistive tooling.",
      "Missing tbody is usually a structural weakness rather than an immediate blocker, but it often points to fragile markup."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Wrap the data rows in tbody once the table has a real header section.",
      "Keep header rows in thead instead of mixing them with data rows.",
      "If different row groups serve different purposes, consider multiple tbody sections where that helps clarity."
    ]
  },
  "Table Header Missing Scope": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a table header cell does not say whether it applies to a row or a column.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Users need the correct row or column context announced with each data cell.",
      "Missing scope becomes more confusing as tables grow wider, taller, or more irregular.",
      "Explicit scope makes simple data tables much more robust for assistive technology."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Use scope='col' for column headers and scope='row' for row headers in simple tables.",
      "Do not rely on styling alone to imply which direction a header applies.",
      "If the table is more complex than simple row and column headers, move to explicit header associations."
    ]
  },
  "Table Missing Header Cells": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a table has data cells but no clear header cells to explain what the data means.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Users can hear or see cell values without knowing what row or column meaning they belong to.",
      "Assistive technology relies on header relationships to announce table context correctly.",
      "A table without headers often behaves like a grid of unexplained values."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Identify which cells are acting as column or row headers.",
      "Use th for actual headers instead of styling td cells to look like headers.",
      "If the structure is only visual layout, do not use a data table at all."
    ]
  },
  "Complex Table Missing Header Associations": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a complex table uses grouped or spanning headers but does not explicitly tie data cells to the right headers.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "In complex tables, simple reading order is not enough to tell users which headers belong to a data cell.",
      "Grouped headers, rowspan, and colspan can produce the wrong spoken context unless associations are explicit.",
      "A table can look correct visually while still announcing the wrong structure to assistive technology."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Look for spanning headers, grouped headers, or more than one header row.",
      "Use headers/id relationships or group-level scope values when simple scope is no longer enough.",
      "Test whether each data cell can be traced back to the right full header context."
    ]
  },
  "Possible Layout Table": {
    overview: "This finding appears when a table looks like it is being used for visual layout instead of real tabular data.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Assistive technology may still announce the structure as a data table even when no true data relationships exist.",
      "Layout tables add noise and can make simple page structure sound much more complicated than it is.",
      "Modern layout tools usually express design intent more clearly than a table used only for positioning."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "Ask whether the content really has row-and-column meaning or is only being positioned visually.",
      "If it is layout-only, replace the table with CSS layout using div, section, article, or other semantic containers.",
      "If it is actually data, add the missing caption, headers, and grouping instead of treating it like layout."
    ]
  },
  "Non-Semantic Button": {
    overview: "This finding appears when something behaves like a button but is not built as a real button or equally accessible pattern.",
    whyItMatters: [
      "Custom click targets often miss keyboard behavior, focus management, naming, or state exposure.",
      "Users should not have to guess whether an element is actionable or how to activate it.",
      "Native button behavior solves many accessibility problems before custom code even starts."
    ],
    reviewChecklist: [
      "If the control performs an action on the current page, prefer a real button element.",
      "If it actually navigates, use a real link instead of faking a button.",
      "Only keep a custom pattern when you can prove it matches native behavior for keyboard and assistive technology users."
